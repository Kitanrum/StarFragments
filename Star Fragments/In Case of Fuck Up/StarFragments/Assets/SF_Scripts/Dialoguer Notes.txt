Dialoguer Notes!!!

1. Always start with 

	void Awake(){
		Dialoguer.Initialize(); //starts dialoguer
	}

2. Dialoguer.StartDialogue(0, dialoguerCallback); will start your dialogue. Put it wherever you need it to! Trigger it with buttons or with colliders!

3. Dialoguer.ContinueDialogue(); will advance your dialogue.

4. Dialoguer.ContinueDialogue(i); will enable choices so that you can advance.

5. Remember the enums for your dialogue!!!

7. To create a branching dialogue with conditions, make sure you make each choice node lead to a global variable so that you can refer to it in a later script.
